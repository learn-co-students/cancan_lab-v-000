notes

need accepts nested attributes


questions
I don't understand this join and having an entry in Viewers to be able to view the note.  Doesn't seem to be the way cancan is setup from the railscast i saw.

why does a note have a user_id and users, through viewers.   does that cause issues?  Note is created by a user and has many viewers i suppose.

issues
there is a test folder with specs in it also
running rspec says "minitest assertion for ability spec"

it would be nice to have basic lab for this before having to jump through a join table, accepts nested attributes.
